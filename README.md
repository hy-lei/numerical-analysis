# numerical-analysis
This is the github repository for my solutions for homework problems in HKU MATH 3601: Numerical Analysis.  The problems involve 
- Solution of scalar equations: Bisection Method, Newton-Raphson Method, and Secant Method;
- Numerical Linear Algebra: Jacobi Method and Gauss-Seidel Method;
- Polynomial Interpolation: Runge's phenomenon among equi-spaced points and Chebyshev nodes as a solution to mitigate ocillation at boundaries;
- Numerical Integration: Composite trapezoidal rule and composite Simpson's rule;
- Numerical methods for ODE: 4th order Runge-Kutta method.
